Talia is a sim in Second Life that I will be involved in running with a group of friends.
This website will serve as a repository of information for those interested in joining the
sim and roleplaying with us. The initial concept of the page is to make it look as if the
viewer is standing in a town square and they can turn around to view different parts of the
sim, different content in each part.

Currently extremely early stages. Will incorporate java script for smooth transitions between
links to each "district" and the districts themselves will contain 3-5 elements that will be 
interactive and display different graphics.

Graphics will mostly be sourced from second life client.
