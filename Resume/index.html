		<p>I am sending this letter in regards to the position of the Web Programmer that I found posted on your website. 
		I have recently received my certification in Web App Development and I was thrilled to see you were hiring for a 
		position that I am not only excited about but also qualified for. 
		The way I found out about this position is a little convoluted and would be best conveyed in person, but it is quite a story.</p>
		<p>I am currently working in healthcare industry but it has always been my goal to enter the IT industry in general, and game 
		development specifically. For that purpose I have enrolled in school and through hard work and determination I am approaching my graduation. 
		When I found the opening you have, I decided I am ready to make that first step. I have been a fan of the Guild Wars franchise since launch 
		of Guild Wars 2 and I consider this opportunity too good to pass.</p>
		<p>While my work experience is not IT related, it did give me experience in team management, teamwork, and customer communication, which I 
		consider to be both extremely important skills for an industry with possibly the highest fan engagement with the creators, and skills that are 
		much harder to learn than technical ones. I am also extremely flexible and easily adapt to new situations and environments which allows me to 
		quickly learn the workplace culture and contribute my skills and experience from living and working around the world. I actually consider my 
		lack of experience in the industry as an advantage as it will allow me to grow in a direction that best benefits the Arena Net team without a 
		burden of old habits or arrogance of someone who thinks they know it all.</p>
		<p>As you can see from my resume, I am currently located in Ohio, but I consider this an opportunity well worth the long journey to Washington 
		and relocating. You can start exploring this web resume that I wrote specifically for this position by clicking the arcane circle below. I look 
		forward to an opportunity to speak with you in person so that we can discuss my future involvement with projects at Arena Net.</p>
		<p>Sincerely,</br>
		Piotr Chlodnicki</p>
